                <p>
                    I graduated from the Czech university of life sciences in Prague 2010, majoring in economics. I
                    became professionally active already during my studies as a specialist at a small Prague company
                    which foced on European subsidies. After while I decided to explore the world a bit as a babysitter
                    in sunny California. When I came back I got a job at Skoda Transportation as senior manager
                    responsible for Skoda group´s subsidies. While living in Pilsen I became a full-time mom to my
                    daughter who has just turned two.
